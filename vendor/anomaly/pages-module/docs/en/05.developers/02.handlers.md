# Handlers

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

Page `handler` are an extension that let you extend the behavior of pages.

For example you could use a `URL Page Handler` to change the UI for the page into that of a simple redirect. This will prevent you from having to use the Navigation module for a simple off-site link or top level navigation item.

Another example could be a `GitHub Page Handler` that pulls it's content from a github repository to allow collaboration on it. Where all the user has to do is define the source file.

@todo - we need how to build handlers here.
